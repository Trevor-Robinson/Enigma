# Enigma
I am extremely happy with how this project went. I feel like I learned a lot and had some productive struggle, but never got stuck for so long that it became discouraging.

For functionality, I would give myself a 3. All my encrypt and decrypt methods are functional, as are my command line interfaces.

For OOP, I would give myself a 2.75 or a 3. All my classes are specific and none are overly large. Everything only knows about what it should. Each method does 1 thing. I think my shift message method could probably be broken up more, but any time I tried it created one of a couple new bugs that I was unable to track down. As it is now, it works exactly as it should, and I believe all edge cases are accounted for.

For Ruby conventions, I would give myself a 3.5. I think my naming is clear everywhere and my indentation and syntax are good and consistent. No methods are over 10 lines. Hashes were implemented in multiple places in a way that makes sense. And though each is the primary enumerable used, I believe it was the best choice in most situations, as it allowed me to best control my returns, which was important, given the amount of nested iteration.

For TDD, I would give myself a 3. All coverage is at 100%. Mocks and stubs are used in a few places. Edge cases are tested for. Tests were always written before code.
